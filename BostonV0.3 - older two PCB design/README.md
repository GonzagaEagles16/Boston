# Boston V0.3

![1st prototype](https://github.com/bluepylons/Boston/raw/master/graphics/prototype_1_pic.JPG)

These are the PCBs for an older version of Boston. The first two aluminum prototypes use this PCB, which places the controller on a separate daughterboard PCB. The PCB is not compatible with newer versions (the spacing between the F-row and the numrow is larger).

The matrix is different than newer versions and it supports fewer layout (no split backspace, WKL bottom row, or split spacebar support). As a result this has separate QMK files.
