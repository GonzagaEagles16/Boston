Send these files to a laser-cutter or waterjet shop to have them made in the material of your choice. Recommended thickness for material is 1.5mm. Units are in mm 
 
These plate files are provided without any implied warranty for fitness for any purpose. There is no guarantee that any plate you using these files cut will work.

These plates have only been tested in low-carbon steel. Boston only has about 1.5mm of clearance between the bottom of the PCB and the metal case, and a highly flexible plate material (e.g. POM) may cause components on the PCB to contact the case and cause shorting or other electrical issues.
