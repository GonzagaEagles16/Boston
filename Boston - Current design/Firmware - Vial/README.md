## Vial firmware

This is the firmware for [Vial](https://get.vial.today/), an open-source alternative to VIA that allows you to reprogram your keymap on-the-fly. You can flash the boston_vial.bin file using QMK Toolbox, dfu-util, or another utility. Vial should recognize the keyboard, and let you remap keys. 

The source files for Vial are available on the Vial-QMK repo [here](https://github.com/vial-kb/vial-qmk/tree/vial/keyboards/boston).

*Note that Vial is currently in beta, and there may be bugs. Use at your own risk. The Vial firmware for Boston has also only been tested on the standard layout, and although alt layouts (ISO, WKL, etc.) are supported they have not been tested and may have issues. Please contact me if there are any issues.* 

Current files use Vial Version 0.4.1
