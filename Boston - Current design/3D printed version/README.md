## Mechanical CAD

These are the CAD files for the 3D printed version. 

The master assembly is Boston-3D-printed-case.stp. The case was done with a mix of Fusion 360 and later Atom3D (after I decided to stop paying for Fusion) - due to the mix of CAD programs used the master file is actually not particularly editable, so I decided to just provide it as a STEP file that can be opened in any CAD program.
